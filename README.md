# Geek Hunters

Something I used.
Local db mdf file instead of sqlite, because, I use visual studio 2017, and the IDE doesn't have offical SQLite
DDEX provider package.

Entity Framework code first patten.

Seeding default data at DataInitializer.cs to initialize the database calling in  Global.asax file.

Using Ajax helper with razor partial view to implement filter function.

Adding two simple UT cases.

You are working in IT-recruiting agency "Geek Hunters". Your employer asked you to implement Geek Registration System
(GRS). 

Using GRS a recruitment agent should be able to:
  - register a new candidate:
     - first name / last name
     - select technologies candidate has experience in from the predefined list 
  - view all candidates
  - filter candidates by technology


Another developer has partially designed and implemented a
SQLite DB for this project - GeekHunters.sqlite. Feel free to modify a structure to
your needs.

Please fork the project and commit your source code (please do not archive it :) ).

You are free to use **ANY** .net frameworks you need -
Console Application / WPF / aspnet. However, if you decide to go with third
party package manager or dev tool - don't forget to mention them in the
README.md of your fork.

Good luck!

P.S: And unit tests! We love unit tests!
