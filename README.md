# Geek Hunters

You are working in IT-recruiting agency "Geek Hunters". Your employer asked you to implement Geek Registration System
(GRS). 

Using GRS a recruitment agent should be able to:
  - register a new candidate:
     - first name / last name
     - select technologies candidate has experience in from the predefined list 
  - view all candidates
  - filter candidates by technology


Another developer has partially designed and implemented a
SQLite DB for this project - GeekHunters.sqlite. Feel free to modify a structure to
your needs.

Please fork the project and commit your source code (please do not archive it :) ).

You are free to use **ANY** .net frameworks you need -
Console Application / WPF / aspnet. However, if you decide to go with third
party package manager or dev tool - don't forget to mention them in the
README.md of your fork.

Good luck!

P.S: And unit tests! We love unit tests!
